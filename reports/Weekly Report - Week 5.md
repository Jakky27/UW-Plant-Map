# Week 5 Status Reports

## Team Report
### Plans from Last Week
[x] Data modelling and database design. The goal is to draw an ER diagram showing the entities, relations, cardinalities, presumptions and other issues related to database management. 
[x] Software architecture: we will use MVC structure for our project. We need to specify the major functions and components of each part in MVC, and the interfaces between them
[x] Figure out the use of API


### Progress and Issues
*  We learnt about the differences between MVVM and MVC
*  We designed the database and drew the ER diagram
*  We learnt about the differences between software architecture and software design
*  We decided the major function and methods that should be implemented in the project
*  We modified the requirement document with updated information


### Plans for Next Week
[ ] Set up Azure SQL database
[ ] Set up the map and search viewer
[ ] Start coding the database, API calls and models
[ ] Implement major functions such as plant registration

## Contributions of individual team members
**Brian**
*  Last week I wrote that I would  begin talking about architecture and design throughout the next week. Huan and I will finalize the database(s) specifics with a concrete ER diagram and begin looking for and testing different database solutions.
* I finished the first iteration of the ER diagram, there may still be very minor modifications that we make as we code, but this is the foundation that we will start with, also looked at different server hosting options and have decided to use an sql database on Azure.
* Additionally helped outline risks specific to our project and outlined server calls and returns.
* Decided on coding guidelines that the team will follow.
* For next week, I hope to have the Azure database set up, and the server code outlined so that it can be finished within the next two weeks so we can debug before the beta release.


**Daniel**
* Participated in discussion regarding the design/architecture of our project’s software
* Revised documentation based on feedback received last week
* Wrote milestones for project, along with tasks and dependencies
* Plan to begin setting up the basic skeleton for our app’s UI next week


**Huan**
* Participated in the design of architecture and major functions
* Worked on risk summary, test plan and documentation plan
* Revised and reformat the documentation from last week
* Collected learning resources for the team
* Arrange meetings, docs, reminders and other logistics


**Jacky**
* Mainly worked on the Software Design part of the Architecture and Design assignment.
* Setup Android studio and began learning and attempting to prototype the plant map view and search bar functionality.
*  My goals are to have dummy versions of the map and search running (with suggestions), in addition to setting up API calls to the model to post and retrieve data

**Kouroche**

* Worked on the Software Architecture, the different modules and the communication between them. Wrote an overview of the MVC pattern in our app, and the communication to the backend.
* Worked on the alternatives section, in terms of the MVVM pattern and Dependency Injection.
* Worked on the risks (particularly Android testing and how to mitigate).
* Briefly looked at Azure App service and Java server hosting for our API as well as Azure SQL database backend.
* Helped for the database schema, and wrote the software design for the Model part of MVC: thinking about the API and the data that needs to flow between the app and the server.
