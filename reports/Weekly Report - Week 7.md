**Brian**
* Basic server calls have been completed, and with a solid foundation, it is easy now to add additional server functionality
* I also made some minor changes to the database so that it was more inline with our original schema.
* Helped write some of the server controller implementations.
* Over the next week I want to fix some inconsistencies in our coding style/ naming conventions as well as better document our code.


**Daniel**
* Connected front end to back end for registering a plant and mapping submissions
* Completed implementation for front end user flow for registering a plant
* Tested and debugged the app
* Helped write presentation/reflection


**Huan**

**Jacky**
* Implemented the live feed in the frontend
* Helped write the presenation for the live feed portion


**Kouroche**
* Setup Heroku server with auto-deploy, setup the database connection with environment variables.
* Setup the CircleCI auto-deploy on successful builds.
* Fixed multiple bugs and ironed out the backend. 
* Updated the README.md to have information on how to build the components.
* Added an exception handler for error 500s so we can see where they fail.
